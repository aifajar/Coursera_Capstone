# Introduction : Business Problem


Surabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia and the third-largest metropolitan area in Indonesia. As a metropolitan city, all types of Indonesian cuisine and other international restaurants have a presence in Surabaya. 

Indonesian usually don't hesitate to try different cuisines and experience with different flavors, anyone who interested in culinary business can take this opportunity. In many cases, one of the strong consideration to open a new food venue (restaurant, coffe shop, etc) is about the competitors around the location. 

We will make cluster based on food venue categories. Surabaya has 31 districs and each district will be clustered using unsupervised machine learning K-Means clustering algorithm. For the result, we prefer locations that are not already crowded with food venue that has similar categories.

This project can be useful for business owners or any other stakeholders who are looking to open a new food venue in Surabaya. The aim of this project is to carefully analyze appropriate data and find recommendations for the stakeholders.
